          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
          It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
          (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
          objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
          them.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
          operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
          be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
          additional objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
          and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
          renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
          values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
          more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
          provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
          for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
          any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

        You can declare a variable in three ways:
        <p>
          With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
          syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example,
          <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
          generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
          variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
          syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.

      <header>Data types</header>
      <article>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>
                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                NULL, or any other variant.
              </li>
              <li>
                undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
              </li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>
                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                are unique and immutable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
        you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
        functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
        think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
        procedures that your application can perform.

      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <article>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
        true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
        condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
        Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
        condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
        statement, including further nested if statements.
        <p>
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
          conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <code
          >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
          statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
          statement_last; }
        </code>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
        which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
        statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
        general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
        when nesting if statements:

        <code
          >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
        >
        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
        expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
        glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
        an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
        additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

        <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <article>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
        condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

        <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
        false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
        the statement following the loop.

        <p>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
          If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
          condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
          stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
        </p>

        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
          group those statements.
        </p>

        Example:

        <p>
          The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
        </p>

        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
        <p>
          With each iteration,
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
          true, so the loop terminates.
